<h1>Body Image  </h1> 
<p>
The "thin ideal" has existed in Western culture since the 1960s, and it is still increasingly prevalent today in numerous forms of media. 
Our society views a slender, hourglass figure as beautiful, and the media reflects that.

 Despite cultural advances in views on race and gender, Disney lags in advancing their portrayal of body image.
 Princesses and other female roles are displayed with size zero waists, skinny limbs, and even small feet.
 This unnatural, and unhealthy, body size presented in Disney's animated characters however, is what society calls for.

Studies have found that girls playing with Disney Princess toys the most were considerably more likely to buy into gender stereotypes.
"They're not as confident that they can do well in maths and science. 
They don't like getting dirty, so they're less likely to try and experiment with things."
