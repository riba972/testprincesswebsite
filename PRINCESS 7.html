Having said all this, with this issue increasing in awareness, many of the new Disney princesses have portrayed characteristics that would be desirable and would give a positive message to young girls (and boys) throughout the nation. 
Examples include Tiana, while she was gifted with the domestic ability of being a good cook, she wanted to own a restaurant. 
And while the other princesses were working toward getting a man, Tiana was working to get her restaurant. 
She has displayed passion and is hard working to achieve in what she loves to do, cooking.
<br>
<br> 
 And probably the most independent of all, Merida, conveying a strong message of perseverance and obviously girl power!
