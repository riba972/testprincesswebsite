For many of the Disney Princesses, 
their entire existence centred around being beautiful and getting a man.
 That's what they sang about, dreamed about and in some of their cases, struggled to obtain.

Ariel left her loving father to marry a man who she knows very little about and is only attracted because of his looks.  
<br>
<br>
Ariel: 
I can give up my voice, I don't need my voice or a personality to win over a man I have the looks!!

Aurora: My man will come and rescue me, there is no need for me to take a hand and get involved in my own life. YAY!
<br>

Snow White: You are right Aurora! I will happily wait to be rescued, after I have eaten a poisoned apple. 
I can be very gullible sometimes... It's always best to have a man look after me!
